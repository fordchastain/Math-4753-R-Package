## MATH 4753 R Package

This is an R package containing a number of helper functions that I wrote for the course MATH 4753 - Advanced Statistical Methods.

### How to install

To install the package into RStudio, first make you sure you have the package `devtools` installed. To install `devtools`, run the following command:

```
install.packages("devtools")
```

Once you have this package installed, you can install my package with the following command:

```
devtools::install_github("fordchastain/Math-4753-R-Package")
```

If you prefer, you can also clone this repository and import the code directly into RStudio.

### How to run

Once you've installed my package, you can navigate to your packages in RStudio, and find `math4753`. If you click it, the documentation will pop up in the help window.

You can also run the following commands to get info on each function:

#### myci
```
?myci
```

#### myf
```
?myf
```

#### myncurve
```
?myncurve
```

#### mypie
```
?mypie
```

#### mypvalue
```
?mypvalue
```

#### mysample
```
?mysample
```

#### pareto
```

```

#### rsq
